This is a simple example of interacting with another contract deployed on goerli using your own deployed contract.

The run time environment is hardhat.

to start, install the hardhat, and all the relevant packages that is accessible in package.json
then once you write your contract and added the contract address you want to interact with, compile and deploy it using deploy.js
then use the Emit.js example.
